## Integration Complexity: HIGH

### Three Systems Merged
- **KMS:** 156 backend files, 95 frontend files
- **EVAL:** 140 backend files, 78 frontend files  
- **PSQ:** 80 backend files, 75 frontend files

### Impact of Ad-Hoc Requirements
- Requirements changed **30%** during development
- Added **+8-11 months** to timeline (+70% increase)
- Examples: Multi-workspace Dify, unified auth, evolved RBAC system

### Key Integration Challenges
1. ✅ **Multi-tenancy** - Complete across all systems (23 tests verify isolation)
2. ⚠️ **Authentication** - Designed but not fully implemented
3. ✅ **Data models** - Harmonized with role mapping
4. ✅ **Deployment** - Cloud Run orchestration working
