## üìê Mental Model for Three.js

Think of Three.js like a film production:

- **Scene** = The studio where everything happens
- **Camera** = The viewer's perspective
- **Lights** = Illumination for visibility
- **Meshes** = Actors (geometry + material)
- **Renderer** = The camera that captures and displays the scene
- **Animation Loop** = The film running at 60fps

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Read through all documentation** to build comprehensive understanding
2. **Study award-winning examples** to see techniques in action
3. **Build progressively** - start simple, add complexity
4. **Optimize constantly** - performance is critical
5. **Share and iterate** - community feedback is invaluable

Remember: Award-winning sites are built through iteration, attention to detail, and mastery of fundamentals. This documentation gives you the roadmap - your creativity and persistence will get you there.
