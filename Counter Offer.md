Kenny,

Thanks for putting together the proposal. I've given it serious thought, and I appreciate the intent to continue working together. After six years, I value our friendship and what we've built, which is why I want to be direct about what works for me.

**The core issue:** Your offer values my consulting at $50/hour when principal AI engineer rates are $200-300/hour. More importantly, the equity and revenue share terms on my new company don't reflect where we actually are in our respective journeys.

I want to find terms that are genuinely fair to both sides and preserve our relationship. Here's what I propose:

---

## PART 1 — ChatDaddy Collaboration

**Monthly Retainer:** USD $6,000/month × 6 months
**Total Value:** $36,000

**Scope:** CDOS | KMS/EVAL/PSQ | CRM maintenance (approximately 10-15 hours/week)

**Deliverables included:**

- Ongoing maintenance and critical bug fixes
- Dr.Baba PRD and codebase handover
- Developer onboarding support
- ChatDaddy frontend style guide (first version)

**AI Costs:** ChatDaddy covers my AI API costs for work related to ChatDaddy systems (estimated $500-700/month based on current usage)

**Unvested ESOP:** Continue vesting on standard schedule (I remain eligible)

**Rationale:** This is below my standard $200/hour rate, but reflects our history and my desire to ensure smooth continuity for systems I built. The bundled deliverables (PRD, onboarding, style guide) are included as part of the transition rather than charged separately. AI costs are covered separately since they're consumption-based and essential for maintaining AI-powered systems.

## PART 2 — Dr.Baba Collaboration

**Milestone Reward:**Upon securing 5 doctor investors for Dr.Baba:

- USD $5,000 cash bonus
- 3% equity in Dr.Baba (with standard 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff)

**Rationale:** I built the entire technical infrastructure (KMS, EVAL, PSQ) that makes Dr.Baba viable as a platform. The original $30k ESOP (~0.15-0.3% depending on valuation) doesn't reflect the foundational role I played in creating the complete technical foundation. This equity stake recognizes that I built the entire platform that enables the business model.

## PART 3 — New Company Arrangement

This is where we need significant changes. I can't agree to 10% equity + 2.5% ongoing revenue share - that structure would significantly limit my ability to raise investment, bring on partners, and build the company I'm envisioning.

**Instead, I propose:**

### Equity Stake

**2.5% non-voting shares** in the new company

**Rationale:** This mirrors the relationship - similar to my ~1% in ChatDaddy (unvested included). It acknowledges our history and keeps us connected without limiting my ability to structure the cap table for future growth.

### Revenue Share

**None ongoing**

**Rationale:** Revenue share creates complications with investors and partners. The equity stake provides upside if we succeed. Also there is no direct work from and CD team member

### Referral Commission

**15% commission on the first USD $100K** of referred business

**Rationale:** Standard market rate for referrals. Beyond $100K, we move to our company's standard commission structure.

### Investment Option (Optional)

If you'd like to invest **USD $20K cash** at the current pre-seed round, we can discuss increasing the equity to **4-5%** at standard investor terms.

## Why These Terms Make Sense

### For You (ChatDaddy):

- You get 6 months of reliable maintenance at below my market rate ($72/hour vs $200/hour)
- All critical handover work included
- AI costs covered (you were paying these anyway)
- You maintain connection to my success through 2.5% equity
- Dr.Baba gets the support needed for launch

### For Me:

- I can cover my burn rate while building the new company
- I maintain freedom to structure my cap table for investors
- I'm not locked into revenue share that complicates future fundraising
- I can focus on growing without conflicting obligations
- I keep my ESOP upside in ChatDaddy
